# HeartDiseasePredictionRisk

Project Motivation: 
Coronary Heart Disease (also known as Coronary Arty Disease (CAD)) is a type of heart disease that occurs when the arteries of a heart canâ€™t delivery oxygen due to the buildup in plaque. It is the most common form of heart disease. The standard for detecting or establishing presence of CAD is through invasive coronary angiography. Through this process, a thin tube is inserted into the artery in the wrist or groin. Although, it would be beneficial to have a non-invasive way to detect coronary heart disease. 
This data comes from Robert Detrano from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The dataset comprises of 303 observation, 13 features and 1 target attribute.  They include results from non-invasive diagnostic tests, result of invasive coronary angiogram and other patient information needed.  This project aims to answer the question: Can we predict heart disease using patient medical data? By applying machine learning techniques to structured patient data, we attempt to create a model that can predict the presence of heart disease based on various health indicators.
